A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

## Configuring Android Studio to run this new configuration

You can go to the dropdown that says `main.dart` and select `Edit configurations`. Hit the + button and add a new Flutter configuration and name it as you please.
- For the entry point, select Dart's main class.

Once done, you can select any flavor you configured and run it using the play or debug button.
